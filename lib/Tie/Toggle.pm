=head1 NAME

Tie::Toggle - False and true, alternately, ad infinitum.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Tie::Toggle;

    tie my $toggle, 'Tie::Toggle';

	foreach my $number ( 0 .. 10 ) {
		next unless $toggle;

		print $number, "\n";
		}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You use C<Tie::Toggle> to go back and forth between false
and true over and over again. You don't have to worry about
any of this since the magic of tie does that for you by
using C<Tie::Cycle>.  Any time you access the value, it
flips.

You can also use C<Tie::FlipFlop> by Abigail to do the same
thing, but with any two values.
